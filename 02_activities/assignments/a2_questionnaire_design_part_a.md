# Assignment: Questionnaire Design (Part A)

## Requirements
Select one of the scenarios below and design a survey to meet the need(s) outlined in the prompt.

1.	In two to three sentences, describe the purpose of your survey
2.	Describe your target population, sampling frame, sampling units, and overall sampling strategy.
3.	Write a 5-10 question survey to address your chosen scenario below.


### Scenarios
1.	You work in the Human Resources Department at a large tech company. Over the past few months, the company has been experiencing a high turnover rate across many of its departments, specifically within the entry- and lower-level positions. The company wishes to understand why this turnover is happening, and what changes need to occur to improve employee satisfaction.
2.	You work for a Canadian national political party during a federal election. Throughout the campaign period, your party has seen relatively high approval ratings, but an opposing party is also polling favorably and may still have a chance to win the election. You are one month away from the election and you want to understand what voters want from your party and its leader in order to maintain your lead and eventually win the election.
3.	You are a student researcher in the sociology department at the University of Toronto. You are working on a research project that concerns the relationship between music taste and age. This involves both comparisons between different people of different ages and comparisons of the same individual at different ages during their lifetime. You wish to understand to what extent age influences music taste, specifically as it relates to perceptions of popular music. Your results will be written into an academic paper that you hope to publish.


# Your Changes

The number of your chosen topic: `2. Election`

Describe the purpose of your survey:
```
The purpose of the survey is to determine what the target population wants from our political party. This can be related to social issues and the political platform. We want to know what ideas are valued by potentials voters. 
We want to implement those values into the current platform and speaking points to convince voters, our party is the better choice. 
```

Describe your target population, sampling frame, sampling units, and observational units:
```
Target Population: All Canadian citizens  
Sampling Frame: All Canadian citizens, 18 years and older, and voting eligible
Sampling Units: Strata which would be divided up by province, gender/sex, ethnicity/race, age cohort of 10 years, income cohorts
Observational Units: Eligible Canadian voters

The sampling strategy I would implement is a stratified sample. Given we are working at the federal level of politics, we likely have access to lots ofdemographic data on potential votes.  
It would be important to consider many strata because of the diverse Canadian population and vast size, which may affect needs based on voter location.  
My strata would include province, gender/sex, ethnicity/race, age cohort of 10 years, and pre-defined Stats Canada income quintiles.
Province would be important as certain areas arouund the country would likely have different desires. 
As seen recently in the US election, the combination of gender/sex, ethnicity/race and age can tell a story of who is voting for what party. Correctly sampling these three strata would be extremely important to understanding what votes are looking for in a political party and platform.  
Income is the last strata I would include. Based on high, low or middle income classes, needs of potential votes may change. This may be in relation to public benefits, public infrastructure, social services, tax uses and other common issues. Again, this will be important to understanding voter wants.  
As there are many strata involved, this multi-stage could become quite complex. Because of this, simple random samples would occur over telephone or digital contact, as door-to-door sampling would be costly and time consuming.   
The stratified sampling is used to capture the wide diverse issues across Canadian voters. 

```

Your 5-10 question survey:
```
1. What is your province of residence/voting?
2. What is your identified gender?
3. What is your identified ethnicity?
4. What is your age?
5. What is your approximate yearly income?
6. What is your primary voter issue in the upcoming election and why? i.e. environment because I want better green energy initiatives
7. What is one current government policy, bill, program or initiative that could be improved?
8. Can you rank in order, the top 3 federal political parties you would vote for? (1 = most likely to vote for of the top 3, 3 = least likely to vote for of the top 3)
9. What is one aspect you dislike about the oopposing political party?
10. write your question here... (optional)
```
